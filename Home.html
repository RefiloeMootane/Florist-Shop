 They are often linked in the business of serving floral designs, flower arrangements, etc.
 Usually, retail florists purchase flowers from the wholesale florists.
 The major tasks involved in the floristry business are the farming of flowers, 
 flower arrangements and trading them.
 The cut flower businesses manage the supply of raw material required for the floristry business.
Flowers like the Rose, the Jasmine, the Bela,
